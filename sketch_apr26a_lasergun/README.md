# Laser Turret (But It Does Nothing)

### Things Required
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor
- LED inside a transparent pen
- Arduino Microcontroller
- Breadboard
- Wires, resistors, header pins (optional)
- Buzzer
- Time 

### Aim
To achieve absolutely nothing â€”  
by rotating a glowing pen (pretending it's a laser), and simulating a machine gun by blinking LEDs and making terrible noises with a buzzer.  
Object detection is done via HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
